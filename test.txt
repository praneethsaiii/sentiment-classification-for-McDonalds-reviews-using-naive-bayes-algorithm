I'm not a huge mcds lover, but I've been to better ones. This is by far the worst one I've ever been too! It's filthy inside and if you get drive through they completely screw up your order every time! The staff is terribly unfriendly and nobody seems to care.
Terrible customer service. Î¾I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. Î¾There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window. Î¾ I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.
First they "lost" my order, actually they gave it to someone one else than took 20 minutes to figure out why I was still waiting for my order.They after I was asked what I needed I replied, "my order".They asked for my ticket and the asst mgr looked at the ticket then incompletely filled it.I had to ask her to check to see if she filled it correctly.She acted as if she couldn't be bothered with that so I asked her again.She begrudgingly checked to she did in fact miss something on the ticket.So after 22 minutes I finally had my breakfast biscuit platter.As I left an woman approached and identified herself as the manager, she was dressed as if she had just awoken in an old t-shirt and sweat pants.She said she had heard what happened and said she'd take care of it.Well why didn't she intervene when she saw I was growing annoyed with the incompetence?
I see I'm not the only one giving 1 star. Only because there is not a -25 Star!!! That's all I need to say!
Well, it's McDonald's, so you know what the food is. Î¾This review reflects solely on the poor service. Î¾I have been to this location countless times over the years. Î¾They consistently fail on the service end of things. Î¾The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of "sighs" and "lip smacking" when you talk to them. Î¾So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. Î¾The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Î¾Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. Î¾I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. Î¾I could not recommend this location any less. Î¾If you can wait, take a pass. Î¾There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.
This has to be one of the worst and slowest McDonald's franchises there is. Can't figure out why my Egg McMuffin is always on a stale un-toasted English muffin. Bought A chocolate shake today and threw it away.
I'm not crazy about this McDonald's. Î¾This is primarily because they are so slow. Î¾My gosh what exactly is the hold up? Î¾It's FAST food people. Î¾Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. Î¾I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Î¾Spread the word. Î¾Anyway, this location is on a little access road Î¾and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. Î¾It would have helped if there was one. Î¾So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. Î¾This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.
One Star and I'm beng kind. I blame management. last day of free coffee so "we" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. "Which one is which?" I asked... and he smiled and said "One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?
Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.
This McDonald's has gotten much better. Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.
Let's start here only reason I came into McDonald's waste time till girlfriend flight arrives and Î¾for my duaghters. I don't eat fast food ordered two happy meals slow service... While ordering my food Î¾a guy ask the cashier two use his cell in the middle of my order that was strike one then give me little boy toys knowing I have twin girls stabding right in front of him. Im glad I will never have to return here I live way in sandy springs.... I can see the difference between service and the staff The building it self is brand new change your staff this is Blackmac not McDonald's im black myself but telling the truth
Other businesses throughout Metro Atlanta opened their doors to stranded motorists during the Jan. 2014 snow storm. This McDonald's on Camp Creek Parkway told Î¾a group of senior citizens who were on the way home from an outing that they had to leave their restaurant. Î¾All they cared about was the dollar. Î¾After they got that, they were done with them. Î¾Too bad they couldn't have made it down the street to Wendy's or Chic Fil A and other restaurants.
The drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review.This is one of those two lane drive thrus, and I know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window, but almost everytime, the cashier ends up asking me what did I order. Î¾I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer. One of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice. When you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits, but not at this location.
Believe it or not, this used to be q really good McDonalds. The drive throuh is so slow, it is frustrating but the service is always friendly. Food is normally luke warm. My niece likes the toys from McDonalds, I wonder if I pull up to the window and say, let me just get the toy, woulf service be faster?
As the previous yelpers have already stated, this place is pretty slow. The food is usually cold.. and the service....yeah. you guessed it. Poor.
25 minutes in drive through line. Gunshots from the apartments behind. Î¾Worst McDonald's ever!
Super slow service, food's terrible like its been sitting and then reheated. Î¾Everything is out, napkins, iced tea
SLOW-SLOW-SLOW! Î¾Don't go here if you have a flight to catch...or a life to live!!!!! Î¾If you're hungry, wait until you get to the airport. Î¾This particular McDonald's is just not worth your time.
On your way to the airport or just cruising down Camp Creek Pkwy? Î¾Are you absolutely in Love with McDonald's Sweet Tea? Well then don't ever go through this drive thru. Î¾Hands down this is the slowest McDonald's drive thru I've experienced in Atlanta. Î¾Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. Î¾As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. Î¾She told a few of her associates that it was like "syrup" and "liquid diabetes". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! Î¾Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink. So the moral to the story is, if you're on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport, bypass McDonald's and head for Chick-fil-A. #EatMoreChicken
This is the worst McDonalds I have ever seen. Î¾The service was terrible and the employees were either lazy or incompetent. I will never return to this establishment.
I had the McCafe Mocha and must say that it was better than drinking sand and salt water, that's about it.Too sweet and I couldn't even taste the coffee over the other weird flavors going on in this drink.Stick with the Starbucks mocha, folks. Î¾Trust me on this one.
GHETTO!! went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces. Î¾Finally made it inside and it was about 5 customers to one cashier. The shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line. Î¾Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don't like to feel like I am in someone's "hood" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don't care or maybe even steal themselves. Î¾plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes
I visited mcdonalds on Dec 20, 2011 at 12:54 I bought 3 cheese burgers 2 large fries and 2 orders of pies. Î¾They charged me for 3 fries so I went back into store and told the cashier. She denied I said Î¾ I ordered 2 fries. Î¾Then manager came over and said whats the problem. I told him and he said looked into the bag, grabbed the xtra fries and lterally threw them into the waste bucket by the drive tru from the cashier . Î¾Then reached into cash register and gave me change for the fries. Î¾Then i said thank you and he said ok boss and I left. Î¾I then called mcdonalds people via the nimber on the website after I ate. I told then I was going to wait to yelp after I heard from McDonalds. Î¾Still no call or email. Î¾As a side note ...Tom N. Î¾(the otther yelper) is right, they are very rude there and seem bothered to help you and not at all nice to the kids. Î¾The play room is sticky and the video games in ther always cause an altercation with kids and parents. Î¾The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the fries were hot and the sweet potatoe fries were good and warm.
I usually hit the drive thru once or twice a week for breakfast. A lot of times the forget to include the hash brown if I order a meal. If I order hot cakes they usually forget either butter or utinsils prompting me to have to go inside. The food is also very inconsistent.
What a joke.Don't do take out as you will not get anything that you ordered. We prefers and paid for items only to get home with 50% of the order accurate. I've been there numerous times and sadly the same thing happens. It's my fault because I should learn.Does anyone know the owner?I can't believe that he would like this comment. Woodstock Macdonalds is not the place that Ray Crock invented. Save yourself the frustration and waste if money, don't go there!I've learned now.
I wish I can give zero stars. Freezing cold reheated soggy fries and twice fried chewy nuggets = straight to my trash can.
I agree with most reviewers on this one. Staff is always rude and annoyed that you're there!!1 I travel weekly to Atlanta Hartsfield Airport and this McDonald's never has fresh hot coffee at 4:30/5:00 AM. Always have to wait while they brew coffee, WTH!!
I don't think this location deserves even one star. Î¾This is the filthiest McDonalds I have ever visited. Î¾I have been to hundreds of different McDonalds in numerous states as well as 19 foreign countries. I went to this location on 3/29/12 for breakfast. Î¾The first thing I noticed was that the floor was sticky. (A previous reviewer made a similar comment about the play area.) When I noticed this, I said to myself, "this isn't right." Î¾Then when I looked for a place to sit, I spotted all the debris in the seat crevices and the floor. There were also flies in the dining area which I had to repeatedly brush off my food. Î¾As for the food, it seemed OK, except, this was the first time ever that I was given cold syrup for my hotcakes at a McDonalds..
This is one rude Mcdonalds! The food takes longer to prepare than any other Macdonalds I have ever been to. The people working there always seem annoyed like you are bothering them just by being there. I avoid this mc d's whenever I can.
the managers at this mcdonalds are awesome but some of the workers are lazy. Î¾overall an average mcdonalds. Î¾after visiting it and some other once i realized that this one is really average. Î¾the only thing good about this one is that the management is awesome and its across the street from my house so i can sit around and study till midnight and no one bothers me.
It had been a while since I had stopped at this particular one. Î¾They have done a total remodel and it looks fairly fresh. Î¾Stopped by about Î¾10-11pm and went through drive thru. Î¾I thought I'd try a new McWrap. Î¾Got a fry and a spicy chick along with that. Î¾ I was asked to pull up after sitting at the window for a few minutes and they would bring me Î¾my order. Î¾That is fine, except about 15 minutes later I'm still waiting. Î¾So I go to check what is going on and end up waiting another 5 minutes. Î¾ It appeared I wasn't the only one that had a long wait in drive thru as well. Î¾ McWrap - I was disappointed. Î¾Looked like a wrap that had grilled chicken sprinkle with some mixed greens, then had sweet and sour sauce dumped in it.
Disorganized. Î¾Didn't even get to order. Employees were hanging out with friends out front.
This has got to be one of the busiest McDonald's in the metro area ... if not the southeast ... and they are fairly efficient despite being so busy all the time.You can come by just about any time of the day and find the line of cars for the "drive-thru" wrapped around the building...It's generally more efficient to go into the building and place your order than wait in the line of cars spewing smog... and since the building is open 24 hours now that should make it easy to get your McFix...good job, Clairmont McDonald's!
THIS MCDONALDS IS HORRIBLE! They are also down the street from my house. You might just want to go to the next McDonald's down the street, less than half a mile maybe. It's brand new and just opened. The reviews here speak for themselves. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER. they always rush you at drive-thru and never get the meal correct because they are all ignorant fucks who can't speak proper English or don't even know English. They don't even give you time to respond on an order completion. I've dined inside and it was fine, however it was dirty around me on most occasions. But 99% of the time I eat there, MY MEAL IS ALWAYS INCORRECT! Always! It's ridiculous! I found out it's an ongoing problem; especially at this store. The fries are always pre sorted and they are a hot or miss. They are really good or really bad, which is really annoying. The sandwich is the same, sometimes they put fresh dripping meat on the bun and it makes it soggy, which is disgusting. Most of the times the sandwich is just plain incorrect. I've had to call corporate about the poor customer service I've had with employees and several managers at this location; as well as the constant issue of my order being messed up (which is very inconvenient in drive-thru). I'm telling you, go to the next McDonald's. The employees here hate their job and are idiots.
Nuts and bolts: Stopped by on my way into work to grab breakfast after getting some Sam's Club gas.Pros: Convenient location for me, right off I-85. Fast service.Cons: The sausage biscuit I had was sub-par. Î¾The biscuit was overcooked and hard. Î¾The sausage was not cooked enough. Î¾Only gave me one jelly packet. Î¾Most places give me at least two. Î¾Forgot to give me a straw for my sweet tea. Î¾Sweet tea was not sweet enough. Î¾Gave me no napkins. Î¾Neutral: Î¾When I was in line paying, a woman pulled up next to me to complain to the cashier that something was wrong with her order. Î¾So she jumped in front of me to get her order fixed. Î¾Neutral about this since I don't have details.Take home: I will try them one more time. Î¾If they fail again, I will just pass.
The ice cream machine is always "down" after 11 p.m. If you want a hot fudge sundae, don't even bother.
Regular McDonald's. Close to the highway which can be good and bad.
Stopped here on the way downtown this morning to get a yogurt parfait. Î¾These snakes gave me dairy products that had an expired "use by" sticker and I didn't even notice until I was halfway to downtown. Gross, guys. Î¾There's no point in putting freshness dates on your food if the employees can't or won't read.
I highly recommend this McDonalds!******if and only if you are trapped at Northside Hospital, are ravenously hungry, and have absolutely no other option. Î¾Eating at this McDonalds is slightly better than eating out of a vending machine or dumpster.
TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others "trapped" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself "trapped" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). Î¾God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ Î¾YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls! How many more years will you ignore not only the unhealthy food options McDonalds supplies~ but to continue to ALLOW a daily dose of DELIBERATE and DILIGENT unhealthy, negative, and "put upon" attitudes from employees, to be delivered to family, friends and employees that are there only because they CARE and are there for YOUR patients! HOW this does NOT cause you to react and ACT is beyond me.In my world, with SO MANY options available, this place would be GONE ~ like TODAY; certainly NOT any longer than tomorrow!This toxic waste site is dumping daily doses of negativity, inhumanity~ its seeping and reverberating within the walls of this hospital. I know you FEEL IT!
I know i shouldn't need to ask but experience has proven it's a good I idea, tonight I forgot Î¾to ask them to make sure the coffee wasn't old and after i drove any i checked and it was not only old it was cold!
I don't often eat at McDonald's, or ever in fact. I don't have much expectation for healthy foods but the one thing I do expect is decent service and fast food. This branch for neither. Food was really slow to come out and I had to ask thrice for the coffee that i ordered. Shocking service delivery
Little bit more expensive than other Mickey Dee's. Beggars can't be choosy. Slow service and it's packed. its open 24/7/365. and the workers are pretty nice. didn't have many other choices and this filled the need.
This is the McDonald's inside the Northside Hospital.For being the only option to get something to eat (evidently they don't have a proper cafeteria like most hospitals do) it had to do...Complete disorganization are the only two decent words I can come up for this place. Î¾There was a huge rush of people oddly enough that evening, and the staff had no clue what to do. Î¾Orders were wrong, missing items, and the wait time was unbearable.
The worst McDonalds ever. Complete chaos. The prices are higher than the average and they don't have all of the regular items like lattes or fraps. The staff seems to be uninterested in taking or completing your order. It is as if they are aware that you are pretty much at their mercy.
A captive audience of transient visitors and exhausted staff are the only way this McDonalds, which is basically the only food option at Northside Hospital, could possibly stay in business.
